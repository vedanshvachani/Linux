IPtables
IPtables is a Linux command-line utility to manage firewall.
IPtables helps to set firewall policy or rules to allow or block the traffic.
Whenever a connection is established, it goes through some rules that are been set up on IPtables.
If it finds some rules then it will either block or allow the traffic.
It basically verifies all the incoming and outgoing network traffic.

Commands
1.) List all the configured rules.
iptables -L

2.) Flush the rules. It removes all the rules.
iptables -F

3.) Allow the incoming traffic from a specific IP address.
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.x.x -j ACCEPT

4.) Allow the incoming traffic from all the IP address from a given range.
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.x.x/24 -j ACCEPT

5.) Allow the incoming traffic on a particular port.
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -dport 443 -j ACCEPT
