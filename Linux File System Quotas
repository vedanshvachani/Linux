                                              Linux File System Quotas
                                              
Quotas is used to restrict a particular user or a group from creating too many files in the disk.
With quota the system admin can easily manage the disk space.
Quotas are used to manage the number of disk blocks and inodes. 
Quotas are applied on the disk partition

Quota on /home
Setup for quota
vi /etc/fstab
UUID=<uuid of /home> /home ext4 defaults,usrquota,grpquota 0 0 (here we added user and group quota on the /home partition )
save and exit the file
mount -a
still if the /home is not mounted properly you can reboot the system

Quota commands
quotacheck -cuvg /home (  
                    -c creates some quota file on the partition that is specified, in our case /home
                    -u check for user quota
                    -g check for group quota
                    -v verbose mode
                    )
After executing this command you will see 2 files being created in your partition
a.) aquota.user   b.) aquota.group

edquota <username/group> ( edquota is a quota file in which you can add how many files a user can create according to the blocks and
                    inodes. Edit the file.
                    Soft means warning and Hard means the limit.
                    )

quotaon /home (This will enable quota on specific file system that is being mentioned.)

Quota has been configured properly on the /home partition. You can try creating files and see if you are getting a warning
or the error. Warning and error will come if the user tries to exceed the limit. 

If the admin wants to see the report 
repquota -a
This will show the report for all the users.
