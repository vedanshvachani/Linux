                                        How to recover Root password (Centos 7)
As soon as you boot your system press 'e' to edit the boot settings
After that move your cursor to 'ro', and change the word 'ro' (read-only) to 'rw'(read-write)
And add init=/sysroot/bin/sh in the same line
Then press 'Ctrl+x' to continue
This will boot into single user mode
Next type chroot /sysroot on the terminal (This will start a new shell in the single user mode and the /sysroot directory will ack as '/'
passwd root
"Enter the root password"
load_policy -i (This will load all the selinux policy)
retorecon -Rv /etc ( This will restore all the default selinux policies in directory '/etc')
This command is usually used to get back the policy for shadow file i.e. shadow_t. 
reboot -f 


Login as root and you will see your password has been changed
