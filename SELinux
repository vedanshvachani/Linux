                                                SELinux

Security Enhanced Linux is an additional layer of security that is provided by redhat. 
The main goal is to protect the data.
In SELinux every file, directory has a special label called a SELinux context.
Context is basically a SELinux policy given to the directory or a file wether the process 
can access the file or directory. 
SELinux has several context user, role, type and sensitivity. 

Configuration file for selinux is /etc/selinux/config
In this you will see all the modes and which mode is active. 

Commands.
1.) ls -lZ 
To check the SELinux permission of a file or process or directory. 
-l will the show the normal permission of a file or directory
-Z will show you the SELinux rules of a file or directory.

2.) getenforce
To check the current mode of SELinux.
There are three modes of SELinux
  a.) enforcing mode = Tells that all the SELinux is enable and running.
  b.) Permissiove mode = Its mostly used for troubleshooting issues. In permissive mode the 
                         SELinux policies are not enforced. The SELinux doesnot deny any operation
                         but it keeps logs.
  c.) Disabled mode = SELinux is disabled. 

3.) setenforce [1/0/Enforcing/Permissive]
To modify the mode of selinux. 1 is used to switch into enforcing mode, 0 is used to switch into Permissive mode

4.) getsebool -a
Show all the SELinux booleans and their current values. 
SELinux booleans are used to change the behavior of the SELinux policy. 

5.) setsebool -P <boolean> [on|off]
Change the SELinux boolean status to yes or no

6.) chcon <-u user> <-r role> <-t type> file 
Change the file SELinux security context of a file or directory.

7.) restorecon -v 
It restores default SELinux contexts . 

// Both chcon and restorecon are used to change the context of a file. But restorecon is much safer than chcon. 
// While using chcon mistakes can happen while specifying the context manually.

7.) semanage boolean -l 
Shows the status of the boolean.
