                                              NFS (Network File System)
Network File System is created to share files between systems.
There is one server and multiple clients. 
So the clients who are connected to this server can share all the files and it will synced for everyone.

Server setup
su (become root user)
yum install nfs-utils (will install all the necessary packages for nfs)
systemctl start nfs-server (will start the service for nfs-server)
mkdir /nfs-share (this will be the main directory where all the files will be shared).
vi /etc/exports
/nfs-share 192.168.x.x (rw,sync,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check)
192.168.x.x will be clients ip address.
close the /etc/exports file
( rw = read-write access will be provided to both client and the server
  sync = all the files will be synced for every client and the server and happens after the changes are commited
  no_root_squash = by this root user can connect to the shared directory
  no_subtree_check = this means whenever the files get uploaded and if the shared directory is subdirectory then there be no check
                      for the file permissions which is more reliable.
)
exportfs -a (after every update in the entries of /etc/exports you need to run this command, this reloads the file /etc/exports)

Server Setup is done

Client Setup
su (become root user)
yum install nfs-utils
showmount -e 192.168.x.x (this ip is server's ip address)
You will see the entries of /etc/exports

Before executing rest commands go back to the server and type
iptables -F (as client cannont connect with the server because the connection is getting blocked.
            This will flush all the riles from iptables.)
            
 Come back to client
 mkdir /mnt/nfs-share
 mount -t nfs 192.168.x.x:/nfs-share /mnt/nfs-share (the shared directory which was created on server will be mounted on 
            /mnt/nfs-share. )
 (If the mount is not happening try executing iptables -F on the server again. )
 mount | grep nfs (to check if the directory is mounted or not)
 ( Try creating files in /mnt/nfs-share )
 touch /mnt/nfs-share/test
 (You will see this file on the client as well as on the server. )
 
 For permanent mount in the client's system.
 vi /etc/fstab (add a entry)
 192.168.x.x:/nfs-share /mnt/nfs-share nfs defaults 0 0 ( 192.168.x.x is the server's ip address)
 exit the /etc/fstab file
 mount -a (instead of reboot, this will mount all the file systems that are mentioned in /etc/fstab entry.)
 
Client Setup is done
NFS Setup is done. Enjoy!
